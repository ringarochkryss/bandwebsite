Website for a 60:s band 
Bootstrap 4 html5 & Css

I have drawn some images and a background image 

Pith involves including a video and some sound files.
I use BS4 grid 
The site is responsive

I use four colors:
Yellow background: #d9a300 & for the buttons f2Bb0c
Light blue #5b9bd5
Dark blue #222040
White #fdffe5

I have a couple of backup sites in my rep -I have used them when working and they are not included in the site.
The site consists of six html-docs:
Index

All connected to the same CSS -file

No addional Js were used.
