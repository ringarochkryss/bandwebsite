#Milestone1 Training Pitch -Make a website for a band (that already has a fab webiste -or probably 1000...;)

https://ringarochkryss.github.io/milestone1/

Html5, Css3 and Bootstrap 4 - 
The design is supposed to give the impression of a cartoonish 60:ts theme with some crazy colors and rounded shapes.

Pitch involved adding video, music-files and links to social media and we learned a bit of
UX before making this -probably supposed to show that I learned some of that as well.


Personal goal was to dig into the grid and master it (an alter it for responsiveness), so I drawed some pictures and 
put them in the grid. Then I tried to mess it up to a point when the layout looks just as random and handmade as the 
images. Supporting this style I drawed a background-image and I also use a background color to cover up the parts of the site that it doesn't cover (as I didn't want it to repeat). 
I aimed for a look with not so many items but a little bit messy and funny design that hopefully makes the visitor end up with a happy feeling. 

The hole site is based on this grid with about 2/3 to the left and one column to the right. 
I am happy with my right column -that isn't connected with the left column (unless you read the html).
The right column has some cards from Bootstrap...

The Navbar has a combination of buttons and a collapse-function with dropdown. 
The footer has some icon-buttons and a logo that hovers similar to the buttons...


This is my problems with this site so far, I will adjust this list as I continue working on it..

Index: Nav collapse-button- could have a white border- would be nice...I can't convince it of that..
mp3-bars could have been altered in color -but for now I am happy they are playing! I have noticed they look completely different
in Chrome VS Firefox. is it possible to alter them and how? 

I have some headers that hovers with a bottomline.I think the teachers was clear about this beeing out of fashion. 
I couldn't remove it with text-decoration:none... however this website is so out of fashion so in this case I could get away with it... 
But I want to know how to overwrite BS on this point.
