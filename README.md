#### Bugs during testing
   * Main problems for testing was to get my style.CSS to work properly in C9. This was the problem:
   >> Once a setting in the CSS style file was made -changes wouldn't apply to the HTML even after alt F5 restarting the programme, etc
   >> If to change a CSS class setting I had to rename the class and create a new class in the CSS file.
   >> Sometimes CSS had to be written in the HTML to work.
   
   * Problem solving involved: 
   >> Using a lot of Boostrap shorthand CSS in the Html for this project
   >> Change to Visual Studio.
